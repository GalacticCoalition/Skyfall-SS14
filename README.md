Welcome to the Skyfall community server for Space Station 14, a remake of SS13. This game runs on the [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a custom engine developed by the Space Wizards team and written in C#.

## About this Repository

This is a repository specifically tailored for the Skyfall server. It's important to note that while we host and create content for SS14, **we are not the original creators of the Robust Toolbox or the main SS14 content**. These tools were developed by the Space Wizards team.

Our repository contains both RobustToolbox and the unique content pack developed for Skyfall, making it an essential tool for those interested in developing additional content for our server.

## Documentation/Wiki

Our [docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.io/) has extensive documentation on SS14's content, engine, and game design, in addition to numerous resources for those interested in contributing to the project.

## Contributing

We operate on a strict modularity process. Any changes to the core code MUST be made upstream. We have a zero tolerance for non-modularity.

Code **MUST** be made in a way that makes it fully modular, this is absolutely doable, so please try. Otherwise we will not be able to accept the content.

Any additonal content that you plan on adding must be placed in the specified modularisation folder. This should follow the relevant path system.

## Building

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `RUN_THIS.py` to init submodules and download the engine.
3. Compile the solution.
